# Sentiment Analysis: Comparing Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

## Description

This project explores sentiment analysis on user comments extracted from social media platforms. It compares the effectiveness of classical machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) with advanced deep learning models (Neural Networks, LSTM, GRU). The aim is to identify which approach performs better under different conditions.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: User comments sourced from social media.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction (TF-IDF, Word2Vec).
- **Models**:
  - Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest.
  - Deep Learning: Feedforward Neural Networks, LSTM, GRU.
- **Evaluation**: Models are compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
